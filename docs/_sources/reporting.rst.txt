Reporting under the hood
------------------------

There is usually no need to see the specifics of the reporting mechanism. The following properties are important:

- The reportName: usually one of the predefined names
- The reportSpecifierID: an ID that the VEN assigns to the report
- One or more rIDs: each rIDs refers to a specific data-type in the report
- A reportRequestID: the ID that the VEN assigns to the request for a specific report's rID.

A report offering from the VEN contains:

- reportName
- reportSpecifierID
- rID (+)

A report request from the VTN contains:

- rID
- reportRequestID

A report that is delivered to the VTN contains:

- rID
